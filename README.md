# PGDAC-Project #WorkSphere

•	WorkSphere is a full-stack Employee Management System built using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. 
•	The frontend leverages React-Bootstrap for a responsive UI, React Router for navigation, and Axios for secure API communication with the backend. 
•	The backend is developed using Spring MVC for RESTful APIs, Spring Security with JWT for authentication and role-based access control, Hibernate for ORM, and MySQL for data persistence. 
•	The system offers dedicated dashboards for Admin, HR, Manager, and Employee roles. 
•	Key features include sprint-wise performance feedback, leave application and approval workflows, employee profile management, and team member visibility. 
•	The application ensures secure access through JWT tokens and organizes logic using DTOs, services, and JPA entity relationships. 
•	WorkSphere provides a modern, scalable, and secure solution for managing employee data and workflows in a collaborative enterprise environment.
